# Simple GitHub scraper demo

This repository is from a demo I did of setting up a simple [GitHub scraper](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/) using [this template](https://github.com/drzax/simple-scrape-template) for [Hacks/Hackers Brisbane](https://quantsquills.com).

I've turned off the actual scraper since this was only intended as a demo and there are [better sources](https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset?q=%22air%20quality%20monitoring%22) of this particular data.
